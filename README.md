## mobTracker

A first intent to implement Meteor Tracker on top of [Mobservable](https://github.com/mweststrate/mobservable) library.

I create this repo like a easy starting point for envolved developers.

## Instructions.

1- Fork this repo.
2- Make your implementation. Tracker code is on `packages\tracker` folder.
3- Test it.
```
# meteor test-packages packages\tracker
```

Easy, right? :-)

The hard part is reimplement Tracker on top of mobservable.
